# Chap's Challenge

## Starting Game
Run nz.ac.vuw.ecs.swen225.gp20.application.Main to start Chap's Challenge. Chap's Challenge was written in Java 11. We recommend using IntelliJ as this repository has project files that know where libraries are located.

## Resuming Game from Saved Point
After saving and exiting from the main menu, when you launch application.Main again, the saved game immediately resumes. The game looks for saved_state.json in the /levels folder; to prevent this behaviour, delete this file.

```
Helpful hint: The order of how you use the keys matters for the second level.
